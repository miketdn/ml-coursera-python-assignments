    \section{Programming Exercise 1: Linear
Regression}\label{programming-exercise-1-linear-regression}

\subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

In this exercise, you will implement linear regression and get to see it
work on data. Before starting on this programming exercise, we strongly
recommend watching the video lectures and completing the review
questions for the associated topics.

All the information you need for solving this assignment is in this
notebook, and all the code you will be implementing will take place
within this notebook. The assignment can be promptly submitted to the
coursera grader directly from this notebook (code and instructions are
included below).

Before we begin with the exercises, we need to import all libraries
required for this programming exercise. Throughout the course, we will
be using \href{http://www.numpy.org/}{\texttt{numpy}} for all arrays and
matrix operations, and
\href{https://matplotlib.org/}{\texttt{matplotlib}} for plotting.

You can find instructions on how to install required libraries in the
README file in the
\href{https://github.com/dibgerge/ml-coursera-python-assignments}{github
repository}.

    \subsection{Submission and Grading}\label{submission-and-grading}

After completing each part of the assignment, be sure to submit your
solutions to the grader.

For this programming exercise, you are only required to complete the
first part of the exercise to implement linear regression with one
variable. The second part of the exercise, which is optional, covers
linear regression with multiple variables. The following is a breakdown
of how each part of this exercise is scored.

You are allowed to submit your solutions multiple times, and we will
take only the highest score into consideration.

At the end of each section in this notebook, we have a cell which
contains code for submitting the solutions thus far to the grader.
Execute the cell to see your score up to the current section. For all
your work to be submitted properly, you must execute those cells at
least once. They must also be re-executed everytime the submitted
function is updated.

\subsection{Debugging}\label{debugging}

Here are some things to keep in mind throughout this exercise:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Python array indices start from zero, not one (contrary to
  OCTAVE/MATLAB).
\item
  There is an important distinction between python arrays (called
  \texttt{list} or \texttt{tuple}) and \texttt{numpy} arrays. You should
  use \texttt{numpy} arrays in all your computations. Vector/matrix
  operations work only with \texttt{numpy} arrays. Python lists do not
  support vector operations (you need to use for loops).
\item
  If you are seeing many errors at runtime, inspect your matrix
  operations to make sure that you are adding and multiplying matrices
  of compatible dimensions. Printing the dimensions of \texttt{numpy}
  arrays using the \texttt{shape} property will help you debug.
\item
  By default, \texttt{numpy} interprets math operators to be
  element-wise operators. If you want to do matrix multiplication, you
  need to use the \texttt{dot} function in \texttt{numpy}. For, example
  if \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} are two \texttt{numpy} matrices, then the
  matrix operation AB is \texttt{np.dot(A,\ B)}. Note that for
  2-dimensional matrices or vectors (1-dimensional), this is also
  equivalent to \texttt{A@B} (requires python \textgreater{}= 3.5).
\end{itemize}

     \#\# 1 Simple python and \texttt{numpy} function

The first part of this assignment gives you practice with python and
\texttt{numpy} syntax and the homework submission process. In the next
cell, you will find the outline of a \texttt{python} function. Modify it
to return a 5 x 5 identity matrix by filling in the following code:

    \subsubsection{1.1 Submitting solutions}\label{submitting-solutions}

After completing a part of the exercise, you can submit your solutions
for grading by first adding the function you modified to the grader
object, and then sending your function to Coursera for grading.

The grader will prompt you for your login e-mail and submission token.
You can obtain a submission token from the web page for the assignment.
You are allowed to submit your solutions multiple times, and we will
take only the highest score into consideration.

Execute the next cell to grade your solution to the first part of this

    \subsection{2 Linear regression with one
variable}\label{linear-regression-with-one-variable}

Now you will implement linear regression with one variable to predict
profits for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant
franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.
The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for
profits and populations from the cities. You would like to use this data
to help you select which city to expand to next.

The file \texttt{Data/ex1data1.txt} contains the dataset for our linear
regression problem. The first column is the population of a city (in
10,000s) and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that
city (in \$10,000s). A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

We provide you with the code needed to load this data. The dataset is
loaded from the data file into the variables \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}:

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}11}]:} \PY{c+c1}{\PYZsh{} Read comma separated data}

\end{Verbatim}

    \subsubsection{2.1 Plotting the Data}\label{plotting-the-data}

Before starting on any task, it is often useful to understand the data
by visualizing it. For this dataset, you can use a scatter plot to
visualize the data, since it has only two properties to plot (profit and
population). Many other problems that you will encounter in real life
are multi-dimensional and cannot be plotted on a 2-d plot. There are
many plotting libraries in python (see this
\href{https://blog.modeanalytics.com/python-data-visualization-libraries/}{blog
post} for a good summary of the most popular ones).

In this course, we will be exclusively using \texttt{matplotlib} to do
all our plotting. \texttt{matplotlib} is one of the most popular
scientific plotting libraries in python and has extensive tools and
functions to make beautiful plots. \texttt{pyplot} is a module within
\texttt{matplotlib} which provides a simplified interface to
\texttt{matplotlib}'s most common plotting tasks, mimicking MATLAB's
plotting interface.

You might have noticed that we have imported the \texttt{pyplot} module
at the beginning of this exercise using the command
\texttt{from\ matplotlib\ import\ pyplot}. This is rather uncommon, and
if you look at python code elsewhere or in the \texttt{matplotlib}
tutorials, you will see that the module is named \texttt{plt}. This is
used by module renaming by using the import command
\texttt{import\ matplotlib.pyplot\ as\ plt}. We will not using the short
name of \texttt{pyplot} module in this class exercises, but you should
be aware of this deviation from norm.

In the following part, your first job is to complete the
\texttt{plotData} function below. Modify the function and fill in the
following code:

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{    pyplot.plot(x, y, }\StringTok{'ro'}\NormalTok{, ms}\OperatorTok{=}\DecValTok{10}\NormalTok{, mec}\OperatorTok{=}\StringTok{'k'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    pyplot.ylabel(}\StringTok{'Profit in $10,000'}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{    pyplot.xlabel(}\StringTok{'Population of City in 10,000s'}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\end{Verbatim}

    Now run the defined function with the loaded data to visualize the data.
The end result should look like the following figure:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/dataset1.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

Execute the next cell to visualize the data.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]

    To quickly learn more about the \texttt{matplotlib} plot function and
what arguments you can provide to it, you can type \texttt{?pyplot.plot}
in a cell within the jupyter notebook. This opens a separate page
showing the documentation for the requested function. You can also
search online for plotting documentation.

To set the markers to red circles, we used the option
\texttt{\textquotesingle{}or\textquotesingle{}} within the \texttt{plot}
function.

    \begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
{\color{incolor}In [{\color{incolor}14}]:} \PY{o}{?}pyplot.plot
\end{Verbatim}

    
    \begin{verbatim}

Plot y versus x as lines and/or markers.

Call signatures::

    plot([x], y, [fmt], data=None, **kwargs)
    plot([x], y, [fmt], [x2], y2, [fmt2], ..., **kwargs)

The coordinates of the points or line nodes are given by *x*, *y*.

The optional parameter *fmt* is a convenient way for defining basic
formatting like color, marker and linestyle. It's a shortcut string
notation described in the *Notes* section below.

>>> plot(x, y)        # plot x and y using default line style and color
>>> plot(x, y, 'bo')  # plot x and y using blue circle markers
>>> plot(y)           # plot y using x as index array 0..N-1
>>> plot(y, 'r+')     # ditto, but with red plusses

You can use `.Line2D` properties as keyword arguments for more
control on the appearance. Line properties and *fmt* can be mixed.
The following two calls yield identical results:

>>> plot(x, y, 'go--', linewidth=2, markersize=12)
>>> plot(x, y, color='green', marker='o', linestyle='dashed',
...      linewidth=2, markersize=12)

When conflicting with *fmt*, keyword arguments take precedence.

**Plotting labelled data**

There's a convenient way for plotting objects with labelled data (i.e.
data that can be accessed by index ``obj['y']``). Instead of giving
the data in *x* and *y*, you can provide the object in the *data*
parameter and just give the labels for *x* and *y*::

>>> plot('xlabel', 'ylabel', data=obj)

All indexable objects are supported. This could e.g. be a `dict`, a
`pandas.DataFame` or a structured numpy array.


**Plotting multiple sets of data**

There are various ways to plot multiple sets of data.

- The most straight forward way is just to call `plot` multiple times.
  Example:

  >>> plot(x1, y1, 'bo')
  >>> plot(x2, y2, 'go')

- Alternatively, if your data is already a 2d array, you can pass it
  directly to *x*, *y*. A separate data set will be drawn for every
  column.

  Example: an array ``a`` where the first column represents the *x*
  values and the other columns are the *y* columns::

  >>> plot(a[0], a[1:])

- The third way is to specify multiple sets of *[x]*, *y*, *[fmt]*
  groups::

  >>> plot(x1, y1, 'g^', x2, y2, 'g-')

  In this case, any additional keyword argument applies to all
  datasets. Also this syntax cannot be combined with the *data*
  parameter.

By default, each line is assigned a different style specified by a
'style cycle'. The *fmt* and line property parameters are only
necessary if you want explicit deviations from these defaults.
Alternatively, you can also change the style cycle using the
'axes.prop_cycle' rcParam.

Parameters
----------
x, y : array-like or scalar
    The horizontal / vertical coordinates of the data points.
    *x* values are optional. If not given, they default to
    ``[0, ..., N-1]``.

    Commonly, these parameters are arrays of length N. However,
    scalars are supported as well (equivalent to an array with
    constant value).

    The parameters can also be 2-dimensional. Then, the columns
    represent separate data sets.

fmt : str, optional
    A format string, e.g. 'ro' for red circles. See the *Notes*
    section for a full description of the format strings.

    Format strings are just an abbreviation for quickly setting
    basic line properties. All of these and more can also be
    controlled by keyword arguments.

data : indexable object, optional
    An object with labelled data. If given, provide the label names to
    plot in *x* and *y*.

    .. note::
        Technically there's a slight ambiguity in calls where the
        second label is a valid *fmt*. `plot('n', 'o', data=obj)`
        could be `plt(x, y)` or `plt(y, fmt)`. In such cases,
        the former interpretation is chosen, but a warning is issued.
        You may suppress the warning by adding an empty format string
        `plot('n', 'o', '', data=obj)`.


Other Parameters
----------------
scalex, scaley : bool, optional, default: True
    These parameters determined if the view limits are adapted to
    the data limits. The values are passed on to `autoscale_view`.

**kwargs : `.Line2D` properties, optional
    *kwargs* are used to specify properties like a line label (for
    auto legends), linewidth, antialiasing, marker face color.
    Example::

    >>> plot([1,2,3], [1,2,3], 'go-', label='line 1', linewidth=2)
    >>> plot([1,2,3], [1,4,9], 'rs',  label='line 2')

    If you make multiple lines with one plot command, the kwargs
    apply to all those lines.

    Here is a list of available `.Line2D` properties:

      agg_filter: a filter function, which takes a (m, n, 3) float array and a dpi value, and returns a (m, n, 3) array 
  alpha: float
  animated: bool
  antialiased: bool
  clip_box: `.Bbox`
  clip_on: bool
  clip_path: [(`~matplotlib.path.Path`, `.Transform`) | `.Patch` | None] 
  color: color
  contains: callable
  dash_capstyle: {'butt', 'round', 'projecting'}

**Format Strings**

A format string consists of a part for color, marker and line::

    fmt = '[color][marker][line]'

Each of them is optional. If not provided, the value from the style
cycle is used. Exception: If ``line`` is given, but no ``marker``,
the data will be a line without markers.

**Colors**

The following color abbreviations are supported:

=============    ===============================
character        color
=============    ===============================
``'b'``          blue
``'g'``          green
``'r'``          red
``'c'``          cyan
``'m'``          magenta
``'y'``          yellow
``'k'``          black
``'w'``          white
=============    ===============================

If the color is the only part of the format string, you can
additionally use any  `matplotlib.colors` spec, e.g. full names
(``'green'``) or hex strings (``'#008000'``).

**Markers**

=============    ===============================

     \#\#\# 2.2 Gradient Descent

In this part, you will fit the linear regression parameters \(\theta\)
to our dataset using gradient descent.

\paragraph{2.2.1 Update Equations}\label{update-equations}

The objective of linear regression is to minimize the cost function

\[ J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( h_{\theta}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right)^2\]

where the hypothesis \(h_\theta(x)\) is given by the linear model
\[ h_\theta(x) = \theta^Tx = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x_1\]

Recall that the parameters of your model are the \(\theta_j\) values.
These are the values you will adjust to minimize cost \(J(\theta)\). One
way to do this is to use the batch gradient descent algorithm. In batch
gradient descent, each iteration performs the update

\[ \theta_j = \theta_j - \alpha \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left( h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)}\right)x_j^{(i)} \qquad \text{simultaneously update } \theta_j \text{ for all } j\]

With each step of gradient descent, your parameters \(\theta_j\) come
closer to the optimal values that will achieve the lowest cost
J(\(\theta\)).

\textbf{Implementation Note:} We store each example as a row in the the
\(X\) matrix in Python \texttt{numpy}. To take into account the
intercept term (\(\theta_0\)), we add an additional first column to
\(X\) and set it to all ones. This allows us to treat \(\theta_0\) as
simply another 'feature'.

\paragraph{2.2.2 Implementation}\label{implementation}

We have already set up the data for linear regression. In the following
cell, we add another dimension to our data to accommodate the
\(\theta_0\) intercept term. Do NOT execute this cell more than once.

     \#\#\#\# 2.2.3 Computing the cost \(J(\theta)\)

As you perform gradient descent to learn minimize the cost function
\(J(\theta)\), it is helpful to monitor the convergence by computing the
cost. In this section, you will implement a function to calculate
\(J(\theta)\) so you can check the convergence of your gradient descent
implementation.

Your next task is to complete the code for the function
\texttt{computeCost} which computes \(J(\theta)\). As you are doing
this, remember that the variables \(X\) and \(y\) are not scalar values.
\(X\) is a matrix whose rows represent the examples from the training
set and \(y\) is a vector whose each elemennt represent the value at a
given row of \(X\).

     \#\#\#\# 2.2.4 Gradient descent

Next, you will complete a function which implements gradient descent.
The loop structure has been written for you, and you only need to supply
the updates to \(\theta\) within each iteration.

As you program, make sure you understand what you are trying to optimize
and what is being updated. Keep in mind that the cost \(J(\theta)\) is
parameterized by the vector \(\theta\), not \(X\) and \(y\). That is, we
minimize the value of \(J(\theta)\) by changing the values of the vector
\(\theta\), not by changing \(X\) or \(y\). Section \ref{section2} and
to the video lectures if you are uncertain. A good way to verify that
gradient descent is working correctly is to look at the value of
\(J(\theta)\) and check that it is decreasing with each step.

The starter code for the function \texttt{gradientDescent} calls
\texttt{computeCost} on every iteration and saves the cost to a
\texttt{python} list. Assuming you have implemented gradient descent and
\texttt{computeCost} correctly, your value of \(J(\theta)\) should never
increase, and should converge to a steady value by the end of the
algorithm.

\textbf{Vectors and matrices in \texttt{numpy}} - Important
implementation notes

A vector in \texttt{numpy} is a one dimensional array, for example
\texttt{np.array({[}1,\ 2,\ 3{]})} is a vector. A matrix in
\texttt{numpy} is a two dimensional array, for example
\texttt{np.array({[}{[}1,\ 2,\ 3{]},\ {[}4,\ 5,\ 6{]}{]})}. However, the
following is still considered a matrix
\texttt{np.array({[}{[}1,\ 2,\ 3{]}{]})} since it has two dimensions,
even if it has a shape of 1x3 (which looks like a vector).

Given the above, the function \texttt{np.dot} which we will use for all
matrix/vector multiplication has the following properties: - It always
performs inner products on vectors. If
\texttt{x=np.array({[}1,\ 2,\ 3{]})}, then \texttt{np.dot(x,\ x)} is a
scalar. - For matrix-vector multiplication, so if \(X\) is a
\(m\times n\) matrix and \(y\) is a vector of length \(m\), then the
operation \texttt{np.dot(y,\ X)} considers \(y\) as a \(1 \times m\)
vector. On the other hand, if \(y\) is a vector of length \(n\), then
the operation \texttt{np.dot(X,\ y)} considers \(y\) as a \(n \times 1\)
vector. - A vector can be promoted to a matrix using
\texttt{y{[}None{]}} or \texttt{{[}y{[}np.newaxis{]}}. That is, if
\texttt{y\ =\ np.array({[}1,\ 2,\ 3{]})} is a vector of size 3, then
\texttt{y{[}None,\ :{]}} is a matrix of shape \(1 \times 3\). We can use
\texttt{y{[}:,\ None{]}} to obtain a shape of \(3 \times 1\).

    Your final values for \(\theta\) will also be used to make predictions
on profits in areas of 35,000 and 70,000 people.

Note the way that the following lines use matrix multiplication, rather
than explicit summation or looping, to calculate the predictions. This
is an example of code vectorization in \texttt{numpy}.

Note that the first argument to the \texttt{numpy} function \texttt{dot}
is a python list. \texttt{numpy} can internally converts \textbf{valid}
python lists to numpy arrays when explicitly provided as arguments to
\texttt{numpy} functions.

    \subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{2.4 Visualizing
\(J(\theta)\)}{2.4 Visualizing J(\textbackslash{}theta)}}\label{visualizing-jtheta}

To understand the cost function \(J(\theta)\) better, you will now plot
the cost over a 2-dimensional grid of \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\)
values. You will not need to code anything new for this part, but you
should understand how the code you have written already is creating
these images.

In the next cell, the code is set up to calculate \(J(\theta)\) over a
grid of values using the \texttt{computeCost} function that you wrote.
After executing the following cell, you will have a 2-D array of
\(J(\theta)\) values. Then, those values are used to produce surface and
contour plots of \(J(\theta)\) using the matplotlib
\texttt{plot\_surface} and \texttt{contourf} functions. The plots should
look something like the following:

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/cost_function.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

The purpose of these graphs is to show you how \(J(\theta)\) varies with
changes in \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\). The cost function
\(J(\theta)\) is bowl-shaped and has a global minimum. (This is easier
to see in the contour plot than in the 3D surface plot). This minimum is
the optimal point for \(\theta_0\) and \(\theta_1\), and each step of
gradient descent moves closer to this point.

    \subsection{Optional Exercises}\label{optional-exercises}

If you have successfully completed the material above, congratulations!
You now understand linear regression and should able to start using it
on your own datasets.

For the rest of this programming exercise, we have included the
following optional exercises. These exercises will help you gain a
deeper understanding of the material, and if you are able to do so, we
encourage you to complete them as well. You can still submit your
solutions to these exercises to check if your answers are correct.

\subsection{3 Linear regression with multiple
variables}\label{linear-regression-with-multiple-variables}

In this part, you will implement linear regression with multiple
variables to predict the prices of houses. Suppose you are selling your
house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to
do this is to first collect information on recent houses sold and make a
model of housing prices.

The file \texttt{Data/ex1data2.txt} contains a training set of housing
prices in Portland, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house
(in square feet), the second column is the number of bedrooms, and the
third column is the price of the house.

 \#\#\# 3.1 Feature Normalization

We start by loading and displaying some values from this dataset. By
looking at the values, note that house sizes are about 1000 times the
number of bedrooms. When features differ by orders of magnitude, first
performing feature scaling can make gradient descent converge much more
quickly.

    Your task here is to complete the code in \texttt{featureNormalize}
function: - Subtract the mean value of each feature from the dataset. -
After subtracting the mean, additionally scale (divide) the feature
values by their respective ``standard deviations.''

The standard deviation is a way of measuring how much variation there is
in the range of values of a particular feature (most data points will
lie within ±2 standard deviations of the mean); this is an alternative
to taking the range of values (max-min). In \texttt{numpy}, you can use
the \texttt{std} function to compute the standard deviation.

For example, the quantity \texttt{X{[}:,\ 0{]}} contains all the values
of \(x_1\) (house sizes) in the training set, so
\texttt{np.std(X{[}:,\ 0{]})} computes the standard deviation of the
house sizes. At the time that the function \texttt{featureNormalize} is
called, the extra column of 1's corresponding to \(x_0 = 1\) has not yet
been added to \(X\).

You will do this for all the features and your code should work with
datasets of all sizes (any number of features / examples). Note that
each column of the matrix \(X\) corresponds to one feature.

\textbf{Implementation Note:} When normalizing the features, it is
important to store the values used for normalization - the mean value
and the standard deviation used for the computations. After learning the
parameters from the model, we often want to predict the prices of houses
we have not seen before. Given a new x value (living room area and
number of bedrooms), we must first normalize x using the mean and
standard deviation that we had previously computed from the training
set.

     \#\#\# 3.2 Gradient Descent

Previously, you implemented gradient descent on a univariate regression
problem. The only difference now is that there is one more feature in
the matrix \(X\). The hypothesis function and the batch gradient descent
update rule remain unchanged.

You should complete the code for the functions \texttt{computeCostMulti}
and \texttt{gradientDescentMulti} to implement the cost function and
gradient descent for linear regression with multiple variables. If your
code in the previous part (single variable) already supports multiple
variables, you can use it here too. Make sure your code supports any
number of features and is well-vectorized. You can use the
\texttt{shape} property of \texttt{numpy} arrays to find out how many
features are present in the dataset.

\textbf{Implementation Note:} In the multivariate case, the cost
function can also be written in the following vectorized form:

\[ J(\theta) = \frac{1}{2m}(X\theta - \vec{y})^T(X\theta - \vec{y}) \]

where

\[ X = \begin{pmatrix}
          - (x^{(1)})^T - \\
          - (x^{(2)})^T - \\
          \vdots \\
          - (x^{(m)})^T - \\ \\
        \end{pmatrix} \qquad \mathbf{y} = \begin{bmatrix} y^{(1)} \\ y^{(2)} \\ \vdots \\ y^{(m)} \\\end{bmatrix}\]

the vectorized version is efficient when you are working with numerical
computing tools like \texttt{numpy}. If you are an expert with matrix
operations, you can prove to yourself that the two forms are equivalent.

    \paragraph{3.2.1 Optional (ungraded) exercise: Selecting learning
rates}\label{optional-ungraded-exercise-selecting-learning-rates}

In this part of the exercise, you will get to try out different learning
rates for the dataset and find a learning rate that converges quickly.
You can change the learning rate by modifying the following code and
changing the part of the code that sets the learning rate.

Use your implementation of \texttt{gradientDescentMulti} function and
run gradient descent for about 50 iterations at the chosen learning
rate. The function should also return the history of \(J(\theta)\)
values in a vector \(J\).

After the last iteration, plot the J values against the number of the
iterations.

If you picked a learning rate within a good range, your plot look
similar as the following Figure.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics{Figures/learning_rate.png}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

If your graph looks very different, especially if your value of
\(J(\theta)\) increases or even blows up, adjust your learning rate and
try again. We recommend trying values of the learning rate \(\alpha\) on
a log-scale, at multiplicative steps of about 3 times the previous value
(i.e., 0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01 and so on). You may also want to adjust the
number of iterations you are running if that will help you see the
overall trend in the curve.

\textbf{Implementation Note:} If your learning rate is too large,
\(J(\theta)\) can diverge and `blow up', resulting in values which are
too large for computer calculations. In these situations, \texttt{numpy}
will tend to return NaNs. NaN stands for `not a number' and is often
caused by undefined operations that involve −∞ and +∞.

\textbf{MATPLOTLIB tip:} To compare how different learning learning
rates affect convergence, it is helpful to plot \(J\) for several
learning rates on the same figure. This can be done by making
\texttt{alpha} a python list, and looping across the values within this
list, and calling the plot function in every iteration of the loop. It
is also useful to have a legend to distinguish the different lines
within the plot. Search online for \texttt{pyplot.legend} for help on
showing legends in \texttt{matplotlib}.

Notice the changes in the convergence curves as the learning rate
changes. With a small learning rate, you should find that gradient
descent takes a very long time to converge to the optimal value.
Conversely, with a large learning rate, gradient descent might not
converge or might even diverge! Using the best learning rate that you
found, run the script to run gradient descent until convergence to find
the final values of \(\theta\). Next, use this value of \(\theta\) to
predict the price of a house with 1650 square feet and 3 bedrooms. You
will use value later to check your implementation of the normal
equations. Don't forget to normalize your features when you make this
prediction!

     \#\#\# 3.3 Normal Equations

In the lecture videos, you learned that the closed-form solution to
linear regression is

\[ \theta = \left( X^T X\right)^{-1} X^T\vec{y}\]

Using this formula does not require any feature scaling, and you will
get an exact solution in one calculation: there is no ``loop until
convergence'' like in gradient descent.

First, we will reload the data to ensure that the variables have not
been modified. Remember that while you do not need to scale your
features, we still need to add a column of 1's to the \(X\) matrix to
have an intercept term (\(\theta_0\)). The code in the next cell will
add the column of 1's to X for you.

    Optional (ungraded) exercise: Now, once you have found \(\theta\) using
this method, use it to make a price prediction for a 1650-square-foot
house with 3 bedrooms. You should find that gives the same predicted
price as the value you obtained using the model fit with gradient
descent (in Section 3.2.1).
